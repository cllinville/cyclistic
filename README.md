Receommended Marketing Strategies to convert casual members to annual members:
  1. Since casual member usage peaks in warm weather, a discounted promotion can be offered to convert casual members to annual beginning in March or April.
  2. Casual members ride longer and travel further distances than annual members, a rewards program can be made for time and miles traveled on a weekly or monthly basis that will go towards their annual membership fee.
  3. Casual members use more classic bikes than any other bike type, a special discount for classic bikes can be promoted to casual riders to convert to annual.
  4. Casual members ride longer and travel further on the weekends, a "weekend only" annual membership at a discounted price can be used to convert casual weekend riders to annual members.
